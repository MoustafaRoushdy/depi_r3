# Modules
1. Modules are making terraform modular and reusable.
2. modules are just a folder with terraform code inside it.
3. You can call modules from root module or other modules.
4. You can call modules from public registry or private registry or you can have your own modules.
5. Modues inputs are called variables if they don't have default values they are required.
6. you can't reference resources inside modules from root module or other modules directly instead you have to use outputs.

module "module_name" {
  source = "./path to module or registry path"
  version = "x.y.z" # if from registry
  
  # input variables
  var1 = "value1"
  var2 = "value2"
}
